# Talks

I speak on GraphQL, React and JavaScript topics. If you think I would be a good speaker at your event, I would love to hear from you! 

Please know that before I accept an invitation, I want to make sure that a conference aligns with my personal and professional goals in the tech community. Can you let me know a few details and [shoot me an email](mailto:shruti.kapoor08@gmail.com)

1. What is the target audience?
2. Who are some other speakers? 
3. What topics are you hoping to see? 
4. How long are the talks supposed to be? 
5. Is the conference free to the public?
6. What is the speaker compensation and rewards?

I ask for a speaker compensation because I value my time and often have to work on it during my own time. 

I appreciate you thinking of me and giving me an opportunity.
